## WIP



#### Can I use Poindexter with a SPA?
Poindexter requires a static site. If you aren't able to generate one, have a look at [Spank](https://github.com/roxiness/spank).

#### Where can I use Poindexter?
Poindexter can be served from the client, your own backend or a serverless function.

#### How big are the index bundles?
A site like [routify.dev](https://routify.dev) with 65 pages, generates a 65 kb bundle after brotli compression.
